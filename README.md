## ðŸš€ *Techplement Internship Week 1 Task* ðŸš€

This week, I completed the deployment of a monolithic architecture by setting up both WordPress and MySQL on a single EC2 instance. After configuring the environment, I created a custom home page to welcome visitors. It was a great learning experience working with AWS services and handling the entire setup on one instance, which provided insight into managing resources effectively.<br />
